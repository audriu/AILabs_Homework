We take pride in our continuous focus on security; however, sometimes, it comes with the cost of building a terrible feature. Here's why. We recently found ourselves facing a Catch-22 situation, when, due to bugs in Apple's VPN API configuration, we had to choose to either sacrifice our users' experience with the app or, under certain scenarios, put a risk on their security or privacy. We believe such a choice should never occur in the first place, and we suspect that a global tech powerhouse often boasting about its focus on users' privacy understands this as well. As of yet, we are saddened by the fact that our pleas for Apple to implement the necessary fixes on their operating systems continue to be acknowledged yet bafflingly ignored. Being limited in what we can do on our side, we decided to offer a feature that, while aiming to offer the best possible solution security-wise, radically differs from our vision of an intuitive and smooth experience users should expect from their cybersecurity provider.\u00a0 Stay invisible on a local network feature is our way to mitigate the TunnelCrack and TunnelVision vulnerabilities present in the VPN industry. In the case of TunnelCrack, certain routers may be configured in a way where they leak VPN traffic when using non-RFC1918 IP addresses, which is an industry-wide issue and only applies to macOS and iOS platforms. TunnelVision attack, in general, is a network technique that uses an operating system's dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to try to route the traffic outside of the VPN's tunnel.\u00a0 For our macOS VPN clients, the \u201cStay invisible on a local network\u201d feature automatically sets the appropriate API parameters and alerts users when connected to an unsafe network, mitigating the VPN traffic leak on macOS. We have also built an unsecured network detection feature that will detect non-RFC1918 IP ranges, notify about possible risks, and inform users to enable \u201cStay invisible on a local network.\u201d On iOS, the app will also inform users when they connect to an unsecured network through push notifications and in-app messages. The feature was fully released by the beginning of August 2023.\u00a0 In contrast, our iOS VPN clients present more considerable challenges due to issues within Apple's implementation of the API parameters. Notably, in iOS versions 14.2 and above, enabling the \"Stay invisible on a local network\" feature causes internet connections to crash under certain conditions. It also prevents our VPN application from receiving client updates, leading to user internet connection crashes when updates are released. The NordVPN team hopes that this inevitably crude solution for an impossible situation will, for the time being, offer sufficient data privacy for our users and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 prompt Apple to implement the necessary changes faster. \u00a0 What OS are impacted? The TunnelCrack and TunnelVision vulnerabilities affect our macOS and iOS VPN clients, while our Android, Linux, and Windows clients were immune due to implemented mitigations. NordVPN Linux and Windows applications can configure the OS's firewall to prevent any traffic from exiting the device except through the VPN tunnel. \u00a0 What connectivity limitations are put in place when this feature is turned ON? With the feature turned ON, users cannot access other network devices, such as computers, printers, or TVs. The feature also blocks AirDrop usage.\u00a0 \u00a0 What experience-breaking effects can users expect? Enabling the feature in iOS 16.4 and later versions can prevent the NordVPN application from receiving client updates, leading to crashes of the user's internet connection when updates are released. Once users are cut off from the internet, the only solution is a device restart.\u00a0 \u00a0 How can users ensure the safety of their data in NordVPN apps? NordVPN apps do not leak traffic under any known circumstances if the Stay invisible on a local network and Kill Switch\u00a0features are enabled within the app settings menu. It\u2019s important to note that the feature is only available to iOS versions 16 and above. Visual instructions on how to enable the feature on iOS or how to enable this feature on macOS. \u00a0 Does the feature protect users from TunnelVision utilizing Option 121, too?Yes, it does. \u00a0 Can NordVPN provide a bug-free solution without Apple's input?\u00a0 No. Unfortunately, the bugs that come with using our feature are beyond our control. Apple's team has confirmed the bugs' existence and gave no clear timeline for their resolution.\u00a0 \u00a0 What else can users do to ensure a better experience using this feature? We believe that sufficiently maintained digital security is a collective effort. While we will continue searching for better solutions within our capacity, we are adamant that Apple needs to address the urgent issues of significant bugs in their operating systems. We invite everyone who is not indifferent to user privacy and security issues to keep pressuring Apple to fix its shortcomings in VPN API service.

Jailbreaking refers to\u00a0bypassing of certain device restrictions. These restrictions are set by the manufacturer, usually\u00a0in order to increase the security and the reliability of their devices. For instance, Apple restricts the ability of its customers when it comes to downloading applications from outside the Apple App Store. In order to sideload applications, which is to download them from an unofficial source, users must first jailbreak their iOS devices. By doing so, root access is gained, meaning that users can modify the needed files and directories that are otherwise hidden.\u00a0\u00a0 Essentially, jailbreaking\u00a0provides greater control over one's device. However, additional freedom comes at a risk to security as well as privacy. One example stems from potential malware that can be downloaded from insecure sources. Unlike the Apple App Store where apps are thoroughly checked, there is no guarantee that the apps from outside will be safe. In the case that they indeed possess malware,\u00a0your credentials and other personal information could be stolen without your knowledge.\u00a0 How can I know if my device is jailbroken, and can NordVPN protect me if it is? First of all, the iOS version of the NordVPN application comes with a system that automatically detects whether or not your device could be jailbroken. If it is, you will be greeted with the following message:  Additionally, you can also find the jailbreak indication by scrolling to the bottom of the\u00a0Settings menu:  If you suspect that your device may have malware or spyware installed, we\u00a0do not recommend\u00a0installing and using NordVPN. This is because your credentials may be stolen by malicious applications. Additionally, although NordVPN encrypts your connection to the internet, as well as protects your privacy online, it cannot prevent damage from downloading the above-mentioned files.\u00a0  "}, {"url": "https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20465912080785-How-to-get-connection-logs-on-iOS", "title": "How to get connection logs on iOS", "name": "How to get connection logs on iOS", "body": "  This short article will teach you how to acquire connection logs when using our app on an iOS device, such as an\u00a0iPad\u00a0or an\u00a0iPhone.

Setting up NordVPN on a Docker container will secure your internet connection and protect your online privacy of other Docker containers as well. \u00a0   Setting up the Docker environment To build the NordVPN Docker image on Linux, you will first need to set up the Docker environment:   Install the Docker engine on Linux. Once you have Docker installed, go to the terminal.  Create a new directory for your image using this command: mkdir <directory name>   Go to the created directory: cd <path/to/directory>   Create a Dockerfile: touch Dockerfile    Go to the file with your preferred text editor. In this example, we use nano. nano Dockerfile    Copy and paste the following script into the file: FROM ubuntu:24.04RUN apt-get update && \\ apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wget apt-transport-https ca-certificates && \\     apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wget apt-transport-https ca-certificates && \\     wget -qO /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/nordvpn_public.asc https://repo.nordvpn.com/gpg/nordvpn_public.asc && \\    echo \"deb https://repo.nordvpn.com/deb/nordvpn/debian stable main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nordvpn.list && \\    apt-get update && \\    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends nordvpn && \\    apt-get clean && \\    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*ENTRYPOINT /etc/init.d/nordvpn start && sleep 5 && /bin/bash -c \"$@\"CMD bash   Click Ctrl + X, then Y, and finally, Enter to save and exit.

Once you\u2019re certain you\u2019re in the correct directory, you can proceed with building the NordVPN Docker image by following these steps:   Build the image with this command (add your desired image name): sudo docker build -t <image name> . Note: Do not forget the dot at the end of the command line.   Run the image: sudo docker run -it --hostname mycontainer --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 <image name> Explanation:-it - instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the container\u2019s stdin; creating an interactive bash shell in the container;--cap-add - needed to successfully run the NordVPN Daemon and connect to our servers;--sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 - disables IPv6 traffic on Linux for the NordVPN container, making sure that there are no leaks after connecting to our servers.--hostname - the hostname for your container. The flag should be used to prevent Meshnet hostname from changing after restarting the Docker container.   Login to NordVPN using a token method: nordvpn login --token <your token>   After the steps are done, you have successfully set up NordVPN Docker image.

Here\u2019s what we recommend: Close any applications that may be transferring data in the background, e.g. software for downloading or file sharing. Old and sometimes even new routers provided to you by your internet service provider often use outdated firmware or are technically poorly manufactured. This can directly impact your internet speed, so we recommend investing in a better router.

Here\u2019s what we recommend: Make sure you have the latest available drivers and software on your computer, including Ethernet adapter and motherboard drivers, BIOS updates, router firmware, etc. Temporarily disable your firewall to see whether it will have an impact on your overall internet speed. If it does, check your firewall settings and remove unnecessary rules or consider using different firewall software. Close any applications that may be transferring data in the background, e.g. software for downloading or file sharing. Old and sometimes even new routers provided to you by your internet service provider often use outdated firmware or are technically poorly manufactured. This can directly impact your internet speed, so we recommend investing in a better router.

The instructions were made for connection to the US #936\u00a0server. Note that if you connect to the other server, you need to name it in all the steps accordingly. Connect to your Qnap control panel: 1. In order to connect your Qnap NAS device to VPN we will need to access its control panel. The easiest way to do that is using the\u00a0Qfinder app\u00a0provided together with Qnap NAS system. Please run the app and wait a few moments for the Qfinder to find the Qnap connected to your local network. A few moments after opening the app you it should list your NAS device. Double click on it in the list and its control panel will be opened in your default internet browser. 2. You will now be able to log in to your\u00a0Qnap control panel. 3. In order to set up the VPN connection, you will need to use your\u00a0administrator account.\u00a0 Here is a tutorial on how to connect a QNAP NAS via OpenVPN: 1. Start by downloading the manual .ovpn files. Follow the steps below to find the manual connection configuration files:  Log into your Nord Account, and click NordVPN.\u00a0 Scroll down to Advanced Settings and click Set up NordVPN manually.\u00a0 Select the OpenVPN configuration files tab.\u00a0 Find the server you wish to connect to by using the Search bar or by scrolling down and download it by clicking Download UDP or Download TCP.\u00a0 When connecting to OpenVPN & IKEv2 manually, you're going to need to use the Username and Password from the Service credential tab.   \u00a0 We will be connecting to US #936\u00a0server using UDP protocol. The contents of the file are as follows: If you want to connect to a different server, please change the line remote 207.244.71.97 1194 to contain the IP address of the server you want to connect to. You also need to change the CA (text\u00a0 between \"<ca>\" and \"</ca>\" lines) and TLS (text\u00a0 between \"<tls-auth>\" and \"</tls-auth>\" lines) keys to these of the server you want to connect to. You can find the IP addresses as well as CA and TLS keys of the server you want to connect in the .ovpn configuration files that can be downloaded from https://my.nordaccount.com/dashboard/nordvpn/manual-configuration/openvpn/\u00a0(note: the .ovpn file you download from the website cannot be used instead of the file we created, as they have slightly different content)2.\u00a0Create a second text file\u00a0with your username and password. We named the file \"nordvpnpass.txt\". Enter your username in the first line and password in the second line of the file: NordVPN_UsernameNordVPN_Password \u00a0 Follow the steps below to find the service credentials for manual connection setup:  Log into your Nord Account, and click NordVPN.\u00a0 Scroll down to Advanced Settings and click Set up NordVPN manually.\u00a0 Select the Service credentials tab, where you'll find the Username and Password needed to connect manually.   \u00a0 3. Access your\u00a0QNAP user interface. Open the File Station on your QNAP, navigate to the\u00a0/Download/ directory\u00a0and\u00a0create a new folder\u00a0named\u00a0\"VPN\"\u00a0by clicking the \"+\" sign at the top of the window. You should now move the created .ovpn file (in our case, us936.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn) and nordvpnpass.txt file you have created to this directory.\u00a0 4. You also need to\u00a0create another text file\u00a0called\u00a0\"ca.crt\"\u00a0that has to contain the\u00a0CA certificate\u00a0of the server. You can copy the same certificate as used in the .ovpn configuration file. In our case, since we are connecting to US #936\u00a0server, our ca.crt file contains this information content  \u00a0 5. Access your\u00a0QNAP user interface\u00a0again and go to\u00a0Control Panel -> Applications -> VPN Client. 6. In the VPN Client menu from the\u00a0\"Add\"\u00a0Drop down menu select\u00a0\"OpenVPN\". 7. Fill out the OpenVPN client settings:\u00a07.1 Enter \"US936UDP\" as a Profile Name. You can name the profile however you like, however it is most helpful to name it for the server and settings used;7.2 Type in the IP address of the server. You need to enter the same IP address as used in the \"remote\" line in step #1;7.3 Enter your NordVPN credentials;7.4 Change the Encryption to \"Highest (AES 256 bit)\";7.5 Upload the ca.crt file you have created earlier;7.6 Enable \"Allow other network devices in the same subnet to connect to the VPN through the NAS\".  8. You will now need to connect to your QNAP disk station using\u00a0SSH tunnel. For that you can use Putty, WinSCP (Windows) or Terminal (Mac OS X, Linux). In our cases we will be using Putty client for Windows (You can download Putty\u00a0here\u00a0).In the \"Host Name (or IP address)\" field\u00a0enter the local IP address of your QNAP\u00a0(in our case, 192.168.1.60) and click \"Open\". 9. Enter the username and password of your QNAP administrator account.\u00a0 10. Use this command to open the \"vpn_openvpn_client.sh\" file. vi /etc/init.d/vpn_openvpn_client.sh Then press \"A\". \u00a0 Important!!\u00a0Copying the text to the vi editor tends to leave out some of the first characters of the copy-pasted text. You may need to manually type in the missing part of the copied text. Now you need to\u00a0change the beginning of this file\u00a0from  #!/bin/shVPN_CONF=\"/etc/config/vpn.conf\"VPN_NUM=\"$2\"VPN_CONF_S=1VPN_CONF_E=10  to  #!/bin/shOPENVPN=/usr/sbin/openvpnclientPIDFILE=\"/var/run/openvpn.client.pid\"OPENVPN_CONF=\"/share/Download/VPN/us119udp.ovpn\"OPENVPN_CONF_PATH=\"/etc/openvpn\"VPN_CONF=\"/etc/config/vpn.conf\"VPN_NUM=\"$2\"VPN_CLIENT=\"OPENVPN_CLIENT\"\"${VPN_NUM}\"MAX_VPN_INDEX=\"255\"  Once you complete editing the file\u00a0press \"Esc\"\u00a0and enter this command\u00a0\":wq\". It will save all the changes you have made to the file.Also, restarting your QNAP disk station will reset all changes made to this file. Therefore, you will need to repeat this step after each QNAP restart to connect to VPN. \u00a0 11. You can now\u00a0connect to the VPN using this command: openvpn --config /share/Download/VPN/us936.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn 12. Executing the command will not generate any message in the Putty window. Therefore, you need to open the openvpn.log file in the\u00a0/Download/VPN directory\u00a0to confirm that you got connected to the VPN. The last line of the log file should be\u00a0\"Initialization Sequence Completed\""}, {"url": "https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20346744890641-macOS-Ventura-Error-The-Installation-Failed", "title": "macOS Ventura Error: The Installation Failed", "name": "macOS Ventura Error: The Installation Failed", "body": "Here are some steps to solve the issue in case you receive an error message about installation being failed, when installing\u00a0NordVPN on your macOS Ventura\u00a0device.  \u00a0After each step, try to\u00a0install the NordVPN application again.

To gain the benefits of a VPN on OpenWrt, you need a router with both OpenWrt firmware and an enabled OpenVPN client. The main page of the firmware is\u00a0https://openwrt.org/.\u00a0  In order to start, you would need to access your router via SSH using its LAN IP address. By default, the IP address is set to\u00a0192.168.1.1\u00a0and the username is\u00a0root, however, the IP address may differ if you changed any of the default values.\u00a0 The OpenVPN package is not included in the firmware image by default. To install it, please run the following commands:opkg updateopkg install openvpn-opensslopkg install ip-fullAdditionally, you may install the LuCI component of the OpenVPN configuration, however, it is optional. You can do so by running this command:opkg install luci-app-openvpn\u00a0 Once you have installed the OpenVPN package, you can make it launch automatically whenever the router starts by running this command:/etc/init.d/openvpn enable\u00a0 Next, you will need to download the server configuration files.  Follow the steps below to find the manual connection configuration files:  Log into your Nord Account, and click NordVPN.\u00a0 Scroll down to Advanced Settings and click Set up NordVPN manually.\u00a0 Select the OpenVPN configuration files tab.\u00a0 Find the server you wish to connect to by using the Search bar or by scrolling down and download it by clicking Download UDP or Download TCP.\u00a0 When connecting to OpenVPN & IKEv2 manually, you're going to need to use the Username and Password from the Service credential tab.   \u00a0  For this guide, we used the server\u00a0uk2054.nordvpn.com, however, you should use the server that the website suggests for you.To download a server file, choose the country where you wish to connect, click on \u201cShow available protocols\u201d, right-click on \u201cDownload config\u201d for \u201cOpenVPN TCP\u201d or \u201cOpenVPN UDP\u201d and choose \u201cCopy link address\u201d.After that, return to your SSH session and run the following command:wget -P /etc/openvpn\u00a0https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/files/ovpn_udp/servers/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpnHowever, make sure to use the link you copied for your specific server file. This command will download the configuration file to the\u00a0/etc/openvpn\u00a0directory for easy access.Alternatively, you may download the server configuration file on a different machine and transfer it to the OpenWrt router using alternate methods, such as SCP or SFTP protocols.For older OpenWrt builds:You can simply download an archive here\u00a0https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/archives/certificates/servers.zip. In the downloaded archive, you will find the corresponding files with .crt and .key extensions. The files are specific for each VPN server.\u00a0 The OpenVPN configuration for NordVPN requires you to enter your NordVPN service credential username and password every time OpenVPN starts. However, we will make some adjustments so the credentials would be provided automatically.First, to make the process easier, we will install the\u00a0nano\u00a0text editor by running the following command:opkg install nanoOtherwise, you may use the built-in\u00a0vi\u00a0text editor. For more information regarding text editors, please refer to this article:\u00a0https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/user.beginner.cli.Now, open the downloaded server configuration file using the nano text editor. In our case, the command would be:nano /etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpnAfter that, append the word \u201csecret\u201d (without quotation marks) to the string \u201cauth-user-pass\u201d. The resulting line should be:auth-user-pass secretNow, we need to create a new file named\u00a0secret, where the NordVPN service credentials will be stored. To do so, run the following command:nano /etc/openvpn/secretIt will create the new file and open it using the nano text editor.In the first line of the file enter your NordVPN service username, and the second - NordVPN service password. You can find your NordVPN service credentials (service username and service password) in the\u00a0Nord Account dashboard   Follow the steps below to find the service credentials for manual connection setup:  Log into your Nord Account, and click NordVPN.\u00a0 Scroll down to Advanced Settings and click Set up NordVPN manually.\u00a0 Select the Service credentials tab, where you'll find the Username and Password needed to connect manually.   \u00a0  Configure OpenVPN using the downloaded configuration file in one of two ways:\u00a0  Change the file\u2019s extension from\u00a0.ovpn\u00a0to\u00a0.conf, which will allow OpenVPN to find it automatically by its extension.To do so, you can use the\u00a0mv\u00a0command:mv /etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn /etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.conf\u00a0 Specify the file name in \u201c/etc/config/openvpn\u201d by using the following \u201cuci\u201d commands:uci set openvpn.nordvpn=openvpnuci set openvpn.nordvpn.enabled='1'uci set openvpn.nordvpn.config='/etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn'uci commit openvpnAfter that, the file \u201c/etc/config/openvpn\u201d should contain the following appended strings:config openvpn 'nordvpn'option enabled '1'option config '/etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn'You can check by running this command:tail /etc/config/openvpnYou may also change the file\u2019s extension from\u00a0.ovpn\u00a0to\u00a0.conf\u00a0and specify it in the file \u201c/etc/config/openvpn\u201d - in that case, however, OpenVPN will start with this configuration file just once.\u00a0   Create a new network interface by running the following commands:uci set network.nordvpntun=interfaceuci set network.nordvpntun.proto='none'uci set network.nordvpntun.ifname='tun0'uci commit networkThe file \u201c/etc/config/network\u201d should contain the following appended strings, if everything was done properly:config interface 'nordvpntun'option proto 'none'option ifname 'tun0'It can be checked by using the\u00a0tail /etc/config/network\u00a0command.\u00a0 Create a new firewall zone and add a forwarding rule from LAN to VPN by running the following commands:uci add firewall zoneuci set firewall.@zone[-1].name='vpnfirewall'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].input='REJECT'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].output='ACCEPT'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].forward='REJECT'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].masq='1'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].mtu_fix='1'uci add_list firewall.@zone[-1].network='nordvpntun'uci add firewall forwardinguci set firewall.@forwarding[-1].src='lan'uci set firewall.@forwarding[-1].dest='vpnfirewall'uci commit firewallIf done correctly, the file \u201c/etc/config/firewall\u201d should contain the following appended strings:config zoneoption name 'vpnfirewall'option input 'REJECT'option output 'ACCEPT'option forward 'REJECT'option masq '1'option mtu_fix '1'list network 'nordvpntun'config forwardingoption src 'lan'option dest 'vpnfirewall'You can check by running\u00a0tail -13 /etc/config/firewall\u00a0command. This will display the last 13 lines, which should contain the aforementioned strings.\u00a0 Now you need to configure the DNS servers. The simplest approach is to use NordVPN DNS for the WAN interface of the router. To add NordVPN DNS, run the following commands:uci set network.wan.peerdns='0'uci del network.wan.dnsuci add_list network.wan.dns='103.86.96.100'uci add_list network.wan.dns='103.86.99.100'uci commitIf you receive an error message \u201cuci: Entry not found\u201d after running the\u00a0uci del network.wan.dns\u00a0command, you can disregard it.The file \u201c/etc/config/network\u201d should contain the section \u2018wan\u2019 with the three bottom strings appended:config interface 'wan'<...>option peerdns '0'list dns '103.86.96.100'list dns '103.86.99.100'You can check by running the\u00a0cat /etc/config/network\u00a0command and finding the \u2018wan\u2019 interface in the output.You can also add different DNS addresses, such as Google\u2019s by running these commands:uci set network.wan.peerdns='0'uci del network.wan.dnsuci add_list network.wan.dns='8.8.8.8'uci add_list network.wan.dns='8.8.4.4'uci commitThe appended strings should be similar to the previous ones.\u00a0  (Optional)\u00a0To prevent traffic leakage in case the VPN tunnel disconnects, you can open the \u201c/etc/firewall.user\u201d file using a text editor and add the following content to it:# This file is interpreted as a shell script. # Put your custom iptables rules here, and they will be executed with each firewall (re-)start # Internal uci firewall chains are flushed and recreated on reload, so # put custom rules into the root chains, e.g. INPUT or FORWARD, or into the # special user chains, e.g. input_wan_rule or postrouting_lan_rule. \u00a0 if (! ip a s tun0 up) && (! iptables -C forwarding_rule -j REJECT); then iptables -I forwarding_rule -j REJECT fi Additionally, you should create a file called \u201c99-prevent-leak\u201d in the folder \u201c/etc/hotplug.d/iface\u201d by running\u00a0nano /etc/hotplug.d/iface/99-prevent-leak\u00a0and adding the following content to the file:#!/bin/sh if [ \"$ACTION\" = ifup ] && (ip a s tun0 up) && (iptables -C forwarding_rule -j REJECT); then iptables -D forwarding_rule -j REJECT fi if [ \"$ACTION\" = ifdown ] && (! ip a s tun0 up) && (! iptables -C forwarding_rule -j REJECT); then iptables -I forwarding_rule -j REJECT fi In some cases, the OpenVPN connection can crash with a log output similar to \u201ccouldn\u2019t resolve host\u2026\u201d. In this case, the VPN tunnel itself remains, however, the connection is lost. To reconnect to it automatically, first open the \u201c/etc/rc.local\u201d file using a text editor and add the following line:/etc/openvpn/reconnect.sh &\u00a0 In addition, you need to create the \u201creconnect.sh\u201d file in the \u201c/etc/openvpn\u201d directory. It can be done by running the\u00a0nano /etc/openvpn/reconnect.sh\u00a0command. In the file, enter the following script contents: #!/bin/sh n=10 while sleep 50; do t=$(ping -c $n 8.8.8.8 | grep -o -E '[0-9]+ packets r' | grep -o -E '[0-9]+') if [ \"$t\" -eq 0 ]; then /etc/init.d/openvpn restart fi done When you have followed these instructions, you should be connected using the configured connection. To check if you were successful, visit NordVPN\u2019s homepage \u2014 the status at the top of the page should say \u201cProtected.\u201d If you wish to disconnect the VPN connection, run the following command: service openvpn stop"}, {"url": "https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20339255258897-How-to-configure-IPFire-firewall", "title": "How to configure IPFire firewall", "name": "How to configure IPFire firewall", "body": "  In order to configure IPFire firewall to connect to NordVPN, follow these steps:\u00a0  Access your IPFire via command line as root.

Most of the current websites support only IPv4, while there are quite a few internet service providers (ISPs) that support both IPv4 and IPv6. Here is a real-life example: your ISP is using both protocols and you are connecting to some website or service which supports only IPv4. This is where IPv6 leak may happen - the requests you are sending to that website or service will contain both your IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses. It can happen even if you are using a VPN but this is not the case with NordVPN. How does NordVPN protect you from IPv6 leaks? NordVPN has integrated IPv6 leak protection. You can read more about it here:\u00a0https://nordvpn.com/blog/nordvpn-implements-ipv6-leak-protection/ Depending on your device and/or network, you can disable the usage of IPv6 altogether - in 99.9% cases it will have no extra effect on your internet usage - IPv6 adoption process is slow, and almost all services allow access through IPv4. How else can you protect yourself from IPv6 leak? You can disable IPv6 in your network completely by changing your router configuration. Each router is different\u00a0but most have the ability to turn IPv6 completely off - in that case, you won't have to change anything in your devices. For information on how to disable it on your router, check your router's user manual.

When you are connected to a VPN, your connection speed depends on a number of factors, including the physical proximity of the server, its load, your original internet speed, the VPN protocol you are using, and more. If you are connected to the closest available server through OpenVPN UDP, you can expect around a 30% drop in speed. If that\u2019s too slow, you can use the\u00a0NordLynx\u00a0protocol instead, which provides much better speed.

It does so by combining the\u00a0best features of the VPN and Smart DNS technologies. How does SmartPlay\u00a0work? NordVPN has a huge server network all over the world, but this is not always enough to ensure the best possible experience for our customers. That\u2019s why we use SmartPlay technology. SmartPlay is based on DNS rerouting and uses an additional pool of IP addresses to improve the connection when users try to access certain websites. This technology is not new and is used by almost all major VPN service providers. Here\u2019s how it goes:\u00a0  We purchase services that provide pools of IP addresses. There are two types of pools. The first one consists of IPs purchased from ISPs directly. The second one consists of the IPs of people who have\u00a0voluntarily downloaded\u00a0specific applications on their devices. The sole purpose of these applications is to reward the end user for\u00a0voluntarily sharing\u00a0part of their bandwidth with various services. Each individual who has the app downloaded\u00a0is fully aware of this purpose\u00a0and receives a reward for the traffic sent and received through their device. These IPs are only used initially when forming a connection.\u00a0Regular browsing data and user IPs are never sent this way.  The owner of the IP address\u00a0can\u2019t see any\u00a0identifiable\u00a0individual personal data\u00a0because\u00a0no such data is ever sent.\u00a0  This method is fast and allows us to bypass censorship and provide access to different services all over the world.\u00a0  "}, {"url": "https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20188826004369-Checking-and-changing-your-WiFi-configuration", "title": "Checking and changing your WiFi configuration", "name": "Checking and changing your WiFi configuration", "body": "  \u00a0     Table of contents  Checking connected WiFi configuration Understanding if the WiFi configuration is correct Changing router settings   Checking connected WiFi configuration  When you are connected to WiFi, find the IP configuration of the network you are connected to.

While our team is working on eliminating them, here are some tips on how to avoid them. How to verify if you were contacted by a real NordVPN representative:\u00a0   Check the sender\u2019s email address. Make sure it comes from the official NordVPN (@nordvpn.com, @nordvpnmedia.com) or NordSecurity (@nordsec.com) domains. Look out for spelling errors in the domain name (for example, @n0rdvpn.com), generic email domains (for example, [_]@gmail.com, [_]@yahoo.com, [_]@laposte.net), or unusual domain endings, such as .pw or .biz as well as any punctuation marks such as hyphens, etc. Always question any other domain used, even if the email might look legit, and note that official NordVPN communication will not occur through such emails.  Examine the email. Look out for usual phishing scam indicators, such as grammar mistakes or suspicious attachments and links. Never click on any link or attachment provided if you are not sure the email is legit.\u00a0  If you have doubts\u00a0about the legitimacy of someone claiming they represent NordVPN - you can always\u00a0contact our customer support\u00a0via live chat on our website (support.nordvpn.com) or over email at\u00a0support@nordvpn.com\u00a0to verify the information. If it was determined that the person contacting you was an impersonator and the contact was a phishing attempt, report the sender via your email service as phishing and inform us via our customer support team as soon as possible.  How to double-check if the NordVPN site is legit:\u00a0   Analyze website URL.\u00a0We only use\u00a0https://nordvpn.com/, https://nordvpn.org/, http://nordauth.com/ and http://nordaccount.com/\u00a0domains (also https://support.nordvpn.com/). We do not own\u00a0any other website. Try\u00a0looking for mistakes in the domain (for example, n0rdvpn instead of nordvpn) unusual domain endings, such as\u00a0.top\u00a0or\u00a0.biz.\u00a0  Check the domain age.\u00a0Here\u00a0you can check when the domain was registered and where it was registered. If the website is created only a few hours or days ago, it is a great possibility that there is a scam.\u00a0  Look for a secure connection sign.\u00a0When the site is secure, a padlock sign will appear next to the URL, or the address will be highlighted green. Next to the poorly encrypted scam websites, you will not find such a sign, and in some cases, you will see a \u201cNot secure\u201d notice.\u00a0  Search for the contact details. Scam websites usually do not have any contact details mentioned, such as an E-Mail address. In cases when they do, scammers use very generic Gmail Account contacts.\u00a0  Check out our social media. In case you are still not sure if the website is legit or not, visit NordVPN's social media (Facebook,\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0LinkedIn,\u00a0YouTube, and\u00a0Instagram), where you can find our legitimate link to the NordVPN website.\u00a0  How to check if the NordVPN app is legit:   Download the app from your App Store/Play Store (For iOS and Android devices).\u00a0After typing in \u201cNordVPN\u201d in your application store, the legitimate app will have the most reviews and downloads, so check that before downloading.

By requiring to use the service credentials across third-party apps, we increase our customer security by decreasing the chances of a successful Enumeration Attack. To briefly explain what kind of attack that is, consider the following: when logging into a third-party app, based on the correctness of the provided credentials, the app may react differently. For instance, if your password is correct, but your username isn't, the app may take slightly longer to identify such a mismatch than vice versa (username would be correct but not the password). Such knowledge might potentially be useful for hackers if, for example, they have a database of stolen usernames and passwords and want to check if specific usernames are registered. Hackers can attempt to enter the credentials they have into the login field and check if there is any difference in how the app reacts to mismatches, e.g. how long does it take for an app to prompt a response. When the pattern is established, it is possible to find out what usernames are registered with the service, which allows further breaking into the account by pairing relevant usernames against various known passwords. However, when service credentials are used, any such discrepancies are made close to impossible to detect, which significantly improves general security.      \u00a0   "}, {"url": "https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/19685375790865-What-is-a-proxy-server", "title": "What is a proxy server?", "name": "What is a proxy server?", "body": "In computer networks, a\u00a0proxy server\u00a0acts as an intermediary for queries from internet users seeking resources from other servers.

SOCKS5 also provides authentication, allowing only authorized users to access the server. A SOCKS server connects through TCP to a willful IP address and provides values to forward UDP packets.\u00a0SOCKS operates at Layer 5 of the Open System Interconnection reference model, which is the intermediate session layer between the transport layer and the presentation layerComparison to HTTP\u00a0proxiesSOCKS performs at a lower level than HTTP proxies: SOCKS takes advantage of the handshake protocol to inform the proxy software about the connection the client is attempting to establish and operates as transparently as possible. On the other hand, an HTTP proxy could interpret and copy headers (for instance, to invoke another underlying protocol, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP); nevertheless, an HTTP proxy normally forwards an HTTP request to the eligible HTTP server). Although an HTTP proxy has a variant model in mind, the CONNECT method permits forwarding TCP connections. Nevertheless, SOCKS proxies may work in reverse and forward UDP traffic while HTTP proxies can\u2019t. HTTP proxies usually are more aware of the HTTP protocol and they perform higher-level filtering. However that normally only applies to POST and GET methods but not the CONNECT method.SOCKSLet's take an example: Rob wishes to communicate with Jack over the internet, but a firewall between them operates on his network. Therefore Rob is not authorized to associate with Jack directly. Hence Rob connects to the SOCKS proxy on his network and informing SOCKS proxy about the connection he wills to make to Jack. SOCKS proxy starts a connection through the firewall and eases the communication between Rob and Jack.HTTPUpdate:\u00a0as has been announced a month prior, NordVPN will no longer be offering support for HTTP proxies.\u00a0Click here to read more about it.\u00a0Rob wishes to download a web page from Jack who runs a web server. Rob can\u2019t directly join Jack\u2019s server as a firewall has been put on his network. To get in touch with the server Rob connects to his network HTTP proxy. His web browser communicates straight to the proxy in the same way it would communicate directly with Jack\u2019s server if it could. It transmits a standard HTTP request header. The HTTP proxy connects to Jack\u2019s server and then sends back to Rob any data Jack\u2019s server returns.

How Onion Over VPN works When you connect to an Onion Over VPN server:  Your traffic is encrypted by the\u00a0NordVPN client. The encrypted traffic passes through a NordVPN server, which changes your IP address. Private and secure, your traffic now reaches the Tor network, which adds its own encryption layers. Your traffic is sent through three random Tor servers before it reaches its destination on the internet.  You can find more detailed information on\u00a0our dedicated\u00a0Onion Over VPN\u00a0page.

Onion Over VPN solves this problem by first routing your traffic through a NordVPN server to hide your IP address.

The NordVPN apps employ a few different versions of Kill Switch: On Windows:  The\u00a0Internet Kill Switch\u00a0feature in the\u00a0Windows\u00a0application\u00a0has two operation modes:    Disable internet access when a VPN connection drops unexpectedly\u00a0(default mode). With this mode selected, internet access is disabled only if an active VPN connection is lost due to an error or some other VPN connection related problem.\u00a0  Disable internet access when you disconnect from VPN manually or the connection drops unexpectedly.\u00a0This mode disables internet access whenever there is no active VPN connection.  On iOS and macOS:  The mobile version of Kill Switch in the\u00a0iOS\u00a0application as well as in the\u00a0NordVPN (App store) version\u00a0disables system-wide internet access if the VPN connection suddenly breaks off, thus protecting all the apps without terminating them. It will also try to reconnect you to the last server you were connected to. This feature is enabled by default and not visible in the app settings as a separate option.\u00a0 On\u00a0macOS (NordVPN version), terminates the applications you specify if the VPN connection suddenly breaks off, preventing those applications from sending unprotected traffic to the internet.  On Android:   Kill Switch\u00a0on\u00a0Android version 8.0 or later\u00a0works just like a system-wide Kill Switch,\u00a0blocking any internet access when there is no VPN connection.\u00a0 Most devices (depending on the ROM) that run on\u00a0Android version 7.0 or later\u00a0have the\u00a0Always-on VPN\u00a0functionality, which prevents leaks if the VPN connection suddenly drops. To enable it, go to\u00a0Settings > Connections > More connection settings > VPN. Tap the cog icon next to NordVPN and enable the Always-on VPN toggle switch.  On Linux:  The\u00a0NordVPN client for Linux\u00a0disables system-wide internet access\u00a0if the VPN connection\u00a0suddenly breaks off\u00a0or you\u00a0disconnect manually. You can enable NordVPN Kill Switch feature by typing the\u00a0nordvpn set killswitch on\u00a0command. If you want to disable Kill Switch, type the\u00a0nordvpn set killswitch off\u00a0command.

The security levels and purposes of these VPN protocols are different, but so are our customers\u2019 needs. We encourage you to take a closer look at the strengths and weaknesses of each VPN protocol. While we want you to be able to choose freely, we also feel it\u2019s our duty to advise you on what might suit you best. 1. OpenVPN OpenVPN is a mature and robust piece of open-source software that enables us to provide a reliable and secure VPN service. It is a versatile VPN protocol that can be used on both TCP and UDP ports. OpenVPN supports a great number of strong encryption algorithms and ciphers: to ensure the protection of your data, we use AES-256-GCM with a 4096-bit DH key. If you are conscious about your security and are wondering what the most stable NordVPN protocol is, we recommend OpenVPN. 2. WireGuard (NordLynx)\u00a0(Recommended by NordVPN and used by default in most of our apps) WireGuard is the newest and fastest tunneling protocol, and the entire VPN industry is talking about it. It uses state-of-the-art cryptography that outshines the current leader, OpenVPN. However, it\u2019s still considered experimental, so VPN providers need to look for new solutions (like NordLynx by NordVPN) to overcome WireGuard\u2019s vulnerabilities. Modern, extremely fast, and incredibly lean in its architecture, WireGuard is backed by thorough academic research. WireGuard consists of only 4,000 lines of code, making it easy to deploy, audit, and fix. To put it into perspective, OpenVPN runs on 400,000 lines of code, meaning that WireGuard makes up only 1% of OpenVPN\u2019s massive architecture.\u00a0 NordLynx is currently used by default in NordVPN apps. If you\u2019re wondering which VPN protocol is best for gaming or other online speed-dependent activities, the answer is always NordLynx."}, {"url": "https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/19482835731345-How-to-download-NordVPN-software", "title": "How to download NordVPN software", "name": "How to download NordVPN software", "body": "You can\u00a0download NordVPN\u00a0for the following operating systems: Android Windows macOS iOS/iPhone/iPad Android TV Linux Other devices NordVPN can be used with:  Xbox\u00a0 Playstation Nintendo Switch Fire TV Stick Chromecast Raspberry Pi Chromebook For instructions on how to set up NordVPN on your device, please have a look at our\u00a0NordVPN setup tutorials.\u00a0Note: To use the NordVPN app on any OS, you need an active NordVPN subscription.

Whether you're browsing the internet at home or using public Wi-Fi networks while going out, standard servers provide security and privacy by encrypting your internet traffic and hiding your personal IP address.\u00a0The way standard NordVPN servers work is simple. When you connect to a VPN server, all of your internet traffic is encrypted via a certain VPN protocol. It is then sent through your ISP before reaching a NordVPN server. There, the traffic is decrypted and is then sent to its destination: a web page, banking app, etc.Here is an article that explains how a VPN works in detail.\u00a0How to connect to a standard serverChoose from 3 options: Use the Quick Connect option (1).\u00a0 Select a server from the All countries list (2). Click on an icon on the server map (3).  \u00a0Double VPNDouble VPN servers are specialized security and privacy solutions intended for journalists, political activists, informants, and anyone who wishes to be extra cautious.The key benefit that separates Double VPN from standard servers is that your internet traffic is sent through two VPN servers instead of one, encrypting your data and disguising your personal IP address twice.The additional layer of security comes in handy when traveling through countries with high levels of censorship and/or surveillance.\u00a0Here is how to connect to a Double VPN server:To start using Double VPN servers, open the \u201cSpecialty servers\u201d category in the NordVPN app and click on Double VPN. You will be automatically connected to the fastest available server.\u00a0What to do if Double VPN is missing from my specialty servers list?If you do not see the Double VPN option in the specialty servers list, switch to TCP or UDP OpenVPN protocol.\u00a0Why does my connection feel slow using Double VPN?Your internet connection feels slow using Double VPN because transferring internet traffic through a second server requires additional internet resources. For this reason, we do not recommend using Double VPN for simple, day-to-day activities. If you are still facing speed issues, here are some tips on how to make your VPN faster.\u00a0Onion over VPNOnion Over VPN is a feature that combines the benefits of using The Onion Router (Tor) with VPN tunneling. The result \u2014 an increased level of privacy, essential to those living or passing through countries with heavy surveillance.When connected to an Onion over a VPN server, your internet traffic goes through one of our servers, passes through the Onion network, and only then reaches the internet.Usually, you can access the Onion network only with The Onion Router (Tor) browser. With NordVPN, you don\u2019t need to download a special browser. All you need to do is open the NordVPN app, head over to the specialty servers category, and connect to an Onion Over VPN server. Your internet traffic will then be routed through the Onion network \u2014 no additional applications are required.Onion over VPN is missing from my specialty servers list\u00a0If this happens, please reach out to our support for assistance. How can I reach NordVPN customer support?I can't access the Onion network through the Firefox browser.Don't worry, we have the solution covered in this article: Firefox does not open .onion websites\u00a0Dedicated IPThis category is for our clients who purchased their own dedicated IP addresses.\u00a0Dedicated IP servers function like standard servers, except that you're the only person who is able to access the IP address. When you connect to any other kind of server, your IP address is replaced with the server's IP. The server can be used by many other people, who will be sharing the server's IP address in hiding their personal one. Having people share the IP address may lead to a number of unpleasant inconveniences, solved by owning a dedicated IP address.Some of the benefits of having sole access to an IP address include the possibility to bypass regular VPN blocklists, avoiding CAPTCHA requests, and more.Dedicated IP is missing from my specialty servers list\u00a0If you do not see the Dedicated IP option in the specialty servers list, switch to TCP or UDP OpenVPN protocol.\u00a0I've purchased a dedicated IP address, how do I set it up?Here are tutorials on how to connect to your dedicated IP by NordVPN on different platforms.\u00a0Obfuscated serversHeavy internet restrictions and VPN blocks can be solved by connecting to obfuscated servers.\u00a0These servers bypass VPN-blocking firewalls by using a complicated algorithm.

Let's take a look at the different options and features that you can adjust according to your needs.Swipe up\u00a0on the main screen to find all server options and features. \u00a0     Quick Connect: connect to the closest and least loaded server. This connection method is useful when the specifics of server location or other settings aren't as important as getting lighting-fast service.  Traffic routing: Traffic routing is one of the Meshnet features. It allows you to route all of your Internet traffic through your friends or your other device and use the IP address of that device to access the Internet.\u00a0  Specialty servers:\u00a0NordVPN offers a variety of different types of servers, each with unique benefits. Learn more about them in our dedicated article:\u00a0What do the different server categories mean?\u00a0  Search bar: use it to find specific servers. You can input the name of a country, city, server number, or even the name of the specialty category.  All countries list: another method for connecting - simply scroll through the list for the country you would like to connect to, and then on the country name when you find it.\u00a0  Meshnet: this feature allows you to create\u00a0a secure, private\u00a0network\u00a0for many devices located anywhere in the world, access them remotely, and\u00a0send all your online traffic through another device.\u00a0  Notifications: here you can find all news about the latest updates and security tips.

In short terms, the TCP protocol makes the connection slightly more stable, at the cost of speed. UDP, on the other hand, offers the opposite:\u00a0a speedier, though less reliable connection. NordLynx has the best of both worlds, it provides speed and reliability.Split tunneling:\u00a0this\u00a0allows\u00a0you\u00a0to specify which apps go through the VPN connection.\u00a0DNS:\u00a0specifies a particular DNS server for the NordVPN app.Local network discovery:\u00a0lets you stay invisible to devices on your local area network (LAN) when\u00a0disabled.Metered connection: gives you more control over the data usage.  Tools   Threat Protection: blocks intrusive ads and malicious domains based on DNS filtering. You can enable this feature once you connect to one of the NordVPN's servers.

If you choose to automatically connect to the\u00a0Fastest\u00a0available server, you will be able to choose one of the servers from your\u00a0Recent Connections, one of the\u00a0Specialty servers, or\u00a0a server in a\u00a0specific country.Please note:\u00a0a\u00a0Trusted networks\u00a0section\u00a0is visible\u00a0only on lower versions than Android 10. It allows you to disable Auto-Connect on specific Wi-Fi networks.
